                <b>Salman Salim Khan</b> (born 27 December 1965)[2] is an Indian
                actor, film producer, and television personality who predominantly
                works in Hindi films. In a career spanning over three decades, his
                awards include two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two
                Filmfare Awards as an actor.[3] He has been cited in the media as one
                of the most popular and commercially successful actors of Indian
                cinema.[4][5] Forbes included him in listings of the highest-paid
                celebrities in the world, in 2015 and 2018, with him being the
                highest-ranked Indian in the latter year.[6][7][8] He has starred in
                the annual highest-grossing Hindi films of 10 individual years, the
                highest for any actor.[9]

                Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi
                (1988), followed by his breakthrough with a leading role in Sooraj
                Barjatya's romantic drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), for which he was
                awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He established himself
                with several commercially successful films, including Lawrence
                D'Souza's romantic drama Saajan (1991), Barjatya's family dramas Hum
                Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999), the action
                film Karan Arjun (1995) and the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999). After a
                period of mixed success in romantic comedy, musicals and tragedy drama
                in 2000s, Khan resurrected his screen image with the action film
                Wanted (2009), and achieved greater stardom the following decade by
                starring in the top-grossing action films Dabangg (2010), Ready
                (2011), Bodyguard (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick
                (2014), and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and the dramas Bajrangi Bhaijaan
                (2015) and Sultan (2016). This was followed by a series of
                poorly-received films, with the exception of Bharat (2019) and the
                sequel Tiger 3 (2023).

                In addition to his acting career, Khan is a television presenter and
                promotes humanitarian causes through his charity, Being Human
                Foundation.[10] He has been hosting the reality show Bigg Boss since
                2010.[11] Khan's off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal
                troubles. In 2015, he was convicted of culpable homicide for a
                negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car,
                killing one, but his conviction was set aside on
                appeal.[12][13][14][15] On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a
                blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years
                imprisonment.[16][17] On 7 April 2018, he was out on bail while an
                appeal was ongoing.[18]

                Salman Khan is the eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan and his first wife Sushila Charak, who adopted
                the name Salma.[19][20] Born to a Muslim father and Hindu mother on 27 December 1965, Salman Khan was
                brought up in both faiths.[21] In 1981, when Salim married the actress Helen, the children's
                relationship with their father grew hostile and only recovered years later.[22]

                Salman Khan's paternal great-grandparents are believed to be Alakozai Pashtuns from Afghanistan who
                immigrated to Indore State, Indore Residency (now in Madhya Pradesh), British India in the
                mid-1800s;[23][24][25][26] however, Jasim Khan in his biography of the actor states that his ancestors
                belonged to the Akuzai sub-tribe of the Yusufzai Pashtuns from Malakand in the Swat Valley of North-West
                Frontier Province, British India (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan).[27] His grandfather Abdul
                Rashid Khan was a Deputy Inspector General of the Indore state who was awarded the Diler Jung award of
                the Holkar times.[28] Khan's mother is a homemaker,[29][30] whose father Baldev Singh Charak,[31] a
                Dogra Rajput,[32] comes from Jammu in Jammu and Kashmir[31][33] and whose Maratha mother comes from
                Maharashtra.[30] Khan can also speak Marathi, in addition to Hindi and English.[34] He has two brothers,
                Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan; and two sisters, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, who is married to actor-director
                Atul Agnihotri, and an adopted sister Arpita, who is married to actor Aayush Sharma.[35]
