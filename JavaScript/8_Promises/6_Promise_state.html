     what is a promise?
     a promise like a contract between you and javascript:

     producing code = the work being done (can take time, like fetchning data, waiting for a timer, download)

     consuming code = what to do when the work is done (when the promise is fulfilled or rejected)

    -->
     <script>
        let myPromise = new Promise()
     </script>
